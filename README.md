- If over return -1

### Challenge: Cats and a Mouse

- all rows, columns, diagonals add up to 15
- only distict integers 1 through 9 can be used
- return only the cost

### Challenge: Picking Numbers
Complete the pickingNumbers function.
- Return an integer theat represents the lenght of the longest array that can be created

## 30 Day Challenges
### Day 2 Operators
Worked on math problem to find the total cost of a meal
- given cost of meal
- given percent tip
- given percent tax
- tally up to the nearest integer

### Day 3 Intro to Conditional Statements
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:
- If n is odd, print Weird
- If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
- If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
- If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

### Day 4 Class vs. Instance
Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
- yearPasses() should increase age by 1
- amIOld() should perform the following:
  - if age < 13 print You are young..
  - if age >= 13 and age < 18, pring You are a teenager..
  - otherwise print You are old..

### Day 5 Loops
Given an integer, n, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple n x i (where 1 <= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

### Day 6 Let's Review
Given a sting, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N -1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line. Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.
